# myForkOfSuckess

Hello

here are all my forks of suckless utils . Everything is in the rice directory
install font awsome 5 , it is a very importaint dependency here .
and get python pywal as well , most linux distributions must have this in their official repos , it manages all fo my colors because i am lazy and unfortunately a very bad artist.


first, put the stuff in the suckless diretrory in .suckless, put everything in scripts directory into .scripts put everything in qolscripts in .qolscripts. then put the notification script in your $PATH. then put search-setter.sh to your $HOME and rename it to .search-setter.sh. xinitrc is given.

my init.el ( config file of emacs ) is also put there.

thank you for taking a look at my silly fork , i am planning to distrohop so this repo is just for storing my configuration  , have fun ricing your system 

I don't run arch anymore cause it's too much hassle for me
